						<h3 class="major">1. What is Tao Hands?</h3>
						<p>
							Tao Hands is a unique spiritual transmission that
							enables certified practitioners to give blessings
							for many aspects of life. Tao Hands radiates, Tao
							essence to the recipient and the request, which
							carries the high frequency and vibration of
							unconditional Love, Forgiveness, Compassion,
							Gratitude, Light and more. Tao Hands has the power
							to transform the negative information at the root of
							our many challenges. This could happen instantly or
							little by little. In this way, Tao Hands can help
							restore balance and harmony and support progress
							toward better health and happiness.
						</p>

						<h3 class="major">
							2. How does Tao hands Blessing Work?
						</h3>
						<p>
							Everything has a vibrational field that contains
							information, energy, and matter. According to Dr.
							and Master Sha, creator of Tao Hands and co-founder
							of Tao Science with quantum physicist, Dr. Rulin
							Xiu, what science calls information (or message) is
							the same as soul or spirit. It is this very aspect
							of our being that leads our lives. The positive
							information we carry in our soul is aligned with our
							true essence, like the Tao qualities of love,
							forgiveness, and compassion. The negative
							information we carry in our soul is associated with
							our challenges, such as unbalanced emotions,
							negative thinking, health challenges and more. Tao
							Blessings carry Tao Love, Forgiveness and more and
							transform the message in one’s Soul, Heart, Mind and
							body by removing blockages at all levels thereby
							leading a way to transform and change.
						</p>
						<h3 class="major">2. What is Reiki?</h3>
						<p>
							Reiki is an effective form of energy healing. Reiki
							aids and accelerates the Soul, Mind and Body’s
							healing process. Reiki energy is directly connected
							to the Source of our universe and our being, and
							thus it is linked with Universal Intelligence. This
							intelligence allows it to focus on the most needed
							areas of healing completely automatically, thereby
							suiting the needs of the receiver in the very best
							way. During the healing sessions the Reiki energy
							directs itself to the areas (Soul, Heart, Mind and
							Body), where it’s needed the most
						</p>
						<h3 class="major">
							4. What can I expect in a typical session be of Tao
							Blessing, and Consultation?
						</h3>
						<p>
							All you need to do is just Relax, be comfortable and
							breathe throughout the session. This is your time,
							just be yourself and connect to Heaven. Heaven knows
							the best, just surrender and flow like water.
							<br />
							<br />
							The session will typically last for 30-45 minutes.
							The session will begin by a brief assessment of how
							you feel and what is your request and how do you
							feel emotionally, mentally and physically. The
							assessment session will be followed by few practices
							and blessings. The Practitioner is not required to
							touch the receiver while giving a blessing, the
							blessing is offered from some distance. The Session
							will typically end with a short feedback from you,
							which will help us understand you better and work
							through more in detail with you in future.
							<br />
							<br />
							The Consultation packages are customized to the
							needs of each and every person. This would mean that
							there are a series of sessions where we work on
							every aspect of your life. With our practices,
							meditation and blessings we intend to work on your
							Soul, Heart, Mind and Body level blockages. In every
							session a free blessing would also be provided as
							per your request. The consultation session would
							also last for 30-45 minutes.

							6. What can I expect in a typical session of Reiki?
						</h3>
						<p>
							While receiving reiki all you have to do is close
							your eyes, breathe deeply, and relax. Reiki Session
							usually begins with an assessment where you are
							expected to share your request and let us know what
							is going on with you not only physically but
							emotionally and spiritually as well. Post this, you
							relax, fully clothed, on a couch, while the healer
							holds his hands on or above you.
							<br />
							<br />
							A treatment usually lasts for half an hour or
							sometime longer depending on the treatment required.
							There is no pressure on the body making it ideal for
							treating all ages and conditions, sometimes hands
							are even held away from the body. The energy flows
							wherever it is required (spiritually guided) and can
							normally be felt as a warm sensation or tingling in
							the body. Receiving Reiki is a very relaxing and
							soothing experience! Reiki sessions are always very
							soothing with receivers often going into a
							meditative state or even into a light sleep!
							<br />
							<br />
							Reiki is an excellent therapy for physical healing
							as well as for healing emotional wounds. One can
							view Reiki sessions as an opportunity to center and
							discover what it was that one needed at that moment
							to function more effectively in life. They can be
							your special time to slow down and catch a glimpse
							of your direction and purpose.
						</p>
